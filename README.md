# Exquisite Corpus

*Exquisite Corpus* is an experimental poetry generation tool built from found phrases transfigured into annotated corpora.
It is inspired by surrealist practices such as the Surrealist *[cadavre exquis](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/c/cadavre-exquis-exquisite-corpse)* game, [psychography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_writing), and devotional indexing.
